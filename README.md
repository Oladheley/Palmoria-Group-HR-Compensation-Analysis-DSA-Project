# Palmoria-Group-HR-Compensation-Analysis-DSA-Project
This Power BI project delivers an interactive dashboard for HR compensation analysis. It involved robust data transformation in Power Query (unpivoting, merging), DAX for key metrics (Bonus Amount, Total Salary, Employee Count, Bonus as % of Salary), and dynamic visualizations to reveal compensation trends and employee distribution.
